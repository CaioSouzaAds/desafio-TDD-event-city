"Built a city and event management system in Java using Spring Boot. The project includes RESTful controllers for cities and events, corresponding services, and custom exceptions to handle specific errors such as integrity violations and resource not found. The code is accompanied by integration tests covering scenarios like listing, inserting, and deleting cities, as well as updating events."
